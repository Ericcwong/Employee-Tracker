    Khris helped me out with figuring out that targeting the ID is the best way to either: change, read, update, or delete. Following with it is all a pattern for all of them. Once you figure out one, you will have the other aligned. Thanks Khris!

Hi my name is Eric Wong. I am a student at University of Utah's full stack developer boot camp. I love coding because it is challenging and rewarding. Challenging when the code is not working and it pushes you to think outside the box. It is rewarding when the code aligns and you see the functional do what it is supposed to.
